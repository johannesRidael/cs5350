This is a machine learning library developed by Elijah Anderson for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

The folders named after model types were solutions/used for assignments

The folder named project contains several different models for predicting if a given worker makes over $50k/year. 

The data given was:
  1. age
  2. whether they were self-employed, employed by government, private entity, or never worked
  3. education
  4. years of education

  8. race
  9. gender
  10. capital gain/loss
  11. hours worked a week
  12. native country

The best model, a Neural Network in NN.py achieved over 90% accuracy
